Hello Everyone

When I started writing code in Eclipse I found autocomplete was not working. Found resources online and found out the solution.

Launch Eclipse
Click on Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Click on Content Assist.
Find the option called Auto Activation.
  - Check the option Enable auto activation
 Make sure the below property is set as mentioned below for quick response. 
  - Auto activation delay(ms): 0 or 500 ms
  - Auto activation triggers for Java:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ._
  - Auto activation triggers for JavaDoc: @#
  
 Once everyone is set then please click on Apply and OK to save changes. 
 
 Close and launch Eclipse. Try to enter any property or like sout you will see it outputs System.out.println();
 
 Hope this clears your doubt. 
 
 Regards,
 Raghavendra.
